# CoffeeScript 101

This covers the basics of [CoffeeScript][1] to get started

  - Start with 3.coffee and 4.coffee
  - Files 1.coffee and 2.coffee are a little advanced
  
Thats all. The code is commented for easy reference. To compile the coffee files to JS      
coffee --compile --output js/ coffee/
That will compile or transpile, whatever you call it, every coffee file in the 'coffee' folder to 'javascript' file in 'js' folder.
